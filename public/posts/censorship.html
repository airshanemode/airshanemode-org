<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Biden campaign announces a lid on the press for the day. The NY Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/joe-biden-goes-into-hiding-amid-the-posts-hunter-biden-expose/">reports this</a> as coming from <a href="https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui">Sabrina Siddiqui</a>, a National Politics reporter at the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/">Andy Stone</a>, announces that FB will be &quot;limiting the spread of the story&quot; in a <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1316395902479872000">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Stone works in communications at FB, and according to his twitter bio he previously worked for:</p>

</ul>
<p>While Stone is clearly a career long democratic operative, it&#39;s not clear how important this is, since Stone&#39;s role in the decision to suppress the story is unclear.</p>

Ahmari <a href="https://twitter.com/SohrabAhmari/status/1316490630953086976">asserts</a> this is part of a campaign to &quot;silence&quot; him. These allegations appear to be unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>The Daily Beast associated reporters at Isaac&#39;s shop begin recording an interview. We know this to be the case because the interview is 52 minutes long, and it was posted at 3:52pm EST. We can surmise that the interview took place at the repair shop since they refer to it as &quot;this shop&quot; during the interview, and we can hear what may be a customer or employee leaving at the start of the interview.</p>
<p>The byline of the story and Banco&#39;s subsequent tweets about it would seem to imply that one of the interviewers is Banco. Comparing her <a href="https://youtu.be/9MHxlAJO_wA?t=1261">voice</a> to the voices of the reporters in the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rptrbnd/mac-shop-10-14-cm">interview</a> lends further evidence to this thery.</p>

<p>The Daily Beast files a deceptive <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview">story</a> about their <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rptrbnd/mac-shop-10-14-cm">interview</a>. The story misrepresents the interview and only focuses on a few statements which it takes out of context in order to discredit Isaac.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanmHowell/status/1316470065320144896">tweet</a> by Howell, he was contacted by a couple of staffers at the Daily Beast to coordinate the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/matthewt_ny">Matt Taylor</a> - National Editor at the Daily Beast</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/samstein">Sam Stein</a> - Politics Editor at the Daily Beast</li>
</ul>
<p>The byline of story names Jordan Howell and Erin Banco as authors.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/maddow">Rachel Maddow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/maddow/status/1316489866205683719">tweets</a> the Daily Beast story uncritically to her 10.2 million followers.</p>
<h3 id="-6-00pm-est">~6:00pm EST</h3>
<p>Twitter runs a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1316398754883272704">trend</a> that attempts to discredit assertions in the NY Post article, based only on a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/27/quick-guide-trumps-false-claims-about-ukraine-bidens/">story</a> from September 2019. This article is itself a regurgitation of an even earlier WaPo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-vice-president-biden-said-ukraine-should-increase-gas-production-then-his-son-got-a-job-with-a-ukrainian-gas-company/2019/07/21/f599f42c-86dd-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html">story</a> from July 2019.</p>
<p>The wording of the trend appears to be designed to emphasize that the NY Post article is false, rather than suggesting it may be contradicted by prior reporting, which itself is only based on quotes from a couple of sources close to the matter in Ukraine:</p>
<p>&quot;Joe Biden did not push out a Ukrainian prosecutor for investigating his son, Washington Post confirms&quot;</p>
<p>The timing of this trend&#39;s run can be verified as it was <a href="https://twitter.com/airshanemode2/status/1316530229230407680">screenshotted</a>.</p>
